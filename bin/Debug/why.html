		In this game you are to have a taste of how the world could have been. The Varini people were seen as uncivilized and savage group of people. Tacticus himself often looks down upon the barbarians with sayings such as "Of the name and blessings of Autumn, they are equally ignorant." degrading the intellect of the tribesmen. Many Germanic tribes were unable to form good relationships with the more "advanced" groups, such as the Roman Empire. Due to this they were never able to form strong enough bonds for another nation to help them when they needed assistance. Other nations simply thought they were more powerful or above the Varini.<br>I try to reflect these concepts in the game.<br><br>

		The Varini were trying to survive in the later years; resorting to roaming westward until they merged into other groups such as the Franks and were not heard of again.<br>
		In the game a similar thing happens. Just before when the Varini would have been historically wiped out: the games AI difficulty increases greatly.<br>But... It is possible to take over Europe before this.
