Open Program:
- Double click "TheVarini.exe" OR double click "runProgram.bat"

I have no way of knowing for sure if this program will work on all computers,
so if there is an issue running the program (i.e. an antivirus deletes it or you cannot download it)
then you can still view most of the project by doing so:

1. open a web browser of some kind 
2. drag and drop the "index.html" file into your web browser

note*: Looking at the about page in the games about window breaks some things. There is an option called "Open webbrowser About"
in the tools. This will try to open the index file in your default browser.

This will allow you to view all the text details/about menus in the game in your browser.

Another issue is that the menus in the game might not display properly. In this case you could either change your
display zoom to 125%, or simply read the html files in a webbrowser.

How to change display zoom:
1. r-click desktop
2. click display settings
3. under "Scale and layout" theres a "Change the size of text, apps and other items"
4. click the drop-down and change it to 125%

You will likely not have to do this, but just in case i'll leave this here.
