		The Suevi Federation and the Varini Tribe
	</p>
	<p class="text">
			The Suevi federation was a large group of tribes who had migrated from southern Sweden to northern Germany. They were distinguished from other Germanic tribes because they would twist their hair and bind it in a knot. (Tacitus Germania, p.31) The Suevi were the only group from the pool of Germanic tribes that did this. They were also a group of tribes that were defended by their surroundings and took part in the worship of <a href="data/info/godsinfo.html">Herthus</a>. (Tacitus, Germania, p.32)<br><br>

			The Varini were a tribe that were part of the Suevi.
