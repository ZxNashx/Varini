		Varini Battles
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		The Varini people loved war, they would often attack sporadically with little to no warning due to them attacking based on signs from the <a href="godsinfo.html">Gods</a> that only they knew. Carrying out battles within the tribe or raiding nearby settlements was common for the Varini people.
