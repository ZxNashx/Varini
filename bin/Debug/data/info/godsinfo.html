		Varini Beliefs and Traditions
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		The Varini people were worshippers of the Goddess of the earth; Herthus.<br>
		There were often ceremonies held where one person would be a bridge between the tribe and the gods and instruct the tribe on what to do. In the game you would be in the place of Herthus, and
		lead your tribe to victory. <br><br>

		You start your game off with Askr. He is the first man in norse mythology; and you will eventually run into Embla, the first woman in norse mythology. While this game does not show the creation
		of the Varini people or go in depth with it; it is important to note what the Varini people believed in. I use my creative license a little bit here to have them in the game.<br>Now, where did those people come from?<br><br>

		Ǫnd þau né átto, óð þau né hǫfðo,<br>
		lá né læti né lito góða.<br>
		Ǫnd gaf Óðinn, óð gaf Hœnir,<br>
		lá gaf Lóðurr ok lito góða<br><br>

		As we learned in the class, many native groups passed information down through oral means. For the Varini it was with a poem. The above text is the Old Norse for what is believed to be the first humans story. The Varini creation story. (Poetic Edda, Volospa)<br><br>

		English Version By Benjamin Thorpe:<br>
		Spirit they possessed not, sense they had not,<br>
		blood nor motive powers, nor goodly colour.<br>
		Spirit gave Odin, sense gave Hœnir,<br>
		blood gave Lodur, and goodly colour.<br><br>
		
		There is no consensus on what the exact meaning is with these poems, but it is interesting to look at how they viewed creation. One of my favourite parts of International Aboriginal Studies was looking at all the creation stories. Reading the Poetic Edda is not making a lot of sense to me; but it is still fascinating to try to see from these perspectives.
