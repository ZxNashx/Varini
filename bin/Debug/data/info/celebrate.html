		The Varini people were very serious about war, however they did have their offtime. Their offtime was often granted to them by the <a href="godsinfo.html">Gods</a>. This is why it is your choice, you choose when they receive their breaks. Too often could lead to a drunken disaster. Too few could lead to your people abandoning you. Choose wisely.
