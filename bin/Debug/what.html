		The main idea behind making this game as a Aboriginal Studies project is to really try to show the perspective of what these people believed in and how they lived. With a game as poorly made as this it is quite difficult to get an understanding of it; but for me video games have always been able to convey scenarios and situations better than other forms of media such as songs or paintings. <br>While you may be playing this game through a layer of disconnect due to the poor quality of the game; I believe it is able to show core concepts and ideas revolving around what it could have been like to be Varini.<br><br>
		One thing that I enjoy about games is a sense of immersion. Thinking that whats happening in the game could somehow happen in real life. The nice thing about graphically simple games like this is that it leaves almost everything to the imagination. There is a simulation for you to play with and you are free to visualize how everything is interacting.
